Lucky Candy


How do you place 50 good candies and 50 rotten candies in two boxes such that if you choose a box at random and take out a candy at random, it better be good! 
We need to maximize the probability of getting a good candy when selecting a random box and a random candy from it. 



Hint:Placing all bad in 1 box and all good in another will give the probability of 0.5, which is not the maximum.
